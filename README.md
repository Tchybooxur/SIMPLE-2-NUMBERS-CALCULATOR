# SIMPLE-2-NUMBERS-CALCULATOR
This is a basic app built with html, css &amp; javascript that does arithmetic operations on two numbers.

This was the first coding project given to me at developer's hub by my friends "Omocho Obinna (Zed)" && "Njezi Chigozie (Biggie)".
I built it following the neumorphic styling pattern which I had recently learnt at the time.
